# Go_Learn

This repository contains the learning curve that I adapted to learn Go-lang from scratch.

It contains two main folders:

### Go_Tutorial :
 I've implemented various basic syntax and concepts of Go, gaining familiarity with its syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and more.

### Matrix:
Implemented my own matrix module which can:

->Add 2 matrices

->Subtract 2 matrices

->Perform scalar multiplication on a matrix

->Perform Matrix multiplication on 2 matrices

->Compute the transpose of  a matrix

The main feature of this module is that I used go-routines and it's concurrency patterns to optimise the computation . The module performs any of the above operations and gives the time comparison between the regular computation and the computational method using go-routines.
